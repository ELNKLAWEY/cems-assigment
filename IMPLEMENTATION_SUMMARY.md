## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Grade Enum with Colors
```dart
enum Grade {
  aPlus('A+', 4.0),  // Green output
  a('A', 4.0),
  // ... with colorCode getter
}
```

### 2. Credit-Weighted GPA
```dart
GPA = Σ(grade_points × credits) / Σ(credits)
```

### 3. Bidirectional References
```dart
// Enrollment maintains references to both:
Enrollment.student ↔ Student.enrollments
Enrollment.course ↔ Course.enrollments
```

### 4. Console Table Formatting
```
┌────────┬──────────┬─────────────┐
│ ID     │ Name     │ GPA         │
├────────┼──────────┼─────────────┤
│ S001   │ Alice    │ 3.91        │
└────────┴──────────┴─────────────┘
```

### 5. Validation Layer
```dart
// Service layer validation
if (email already exists) throw ValidationException
// Prevents invalid state
```
